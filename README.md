# PigDiceGame

# Overview
The Pig Game is a simple dice game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach a certain number of points. Players take turns rolling a die, and they can either "Hold" to add their turn score to their total score or "Roll" again to try to accumulate more points. However, if a player rolls a 1, they lose all points accumulated in that turn and their turn ends.
